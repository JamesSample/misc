    "`ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT` shows an example of the output available based on \"species groups\". We want to create similar views for different levels in the taxonomic tree, as defined in the NCBI tables (see KET's e-mails for details). The starting point for this is the `ECOTOX_EXTRACT1_M` view, which contains the basic data, including the Latin name for each organism. The information in this view is then summarised into two more views (`ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_PRIMARY` and `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_REVIEW`), and these are subsequently combined into `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT`, which is what we're interested in here. \n",

The `NCBI_NODES` table does contain this information, but the table structure is recursive: each row has a \"parent\", which defines the heirarchy. It would be more useful to create a flattened version, with the ranks/taxonomic levels as columns and a row for each `tax_id`, something like this:\n",
