I posted a question on Stackoverflow [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43212421/flatten-recursive-taxonomic-table-oracle?noredirect=1#comment73499002_43212421) but have had no responses so far. As time is tight, I've decided to write my own code in Python to acomplish the restructuring, as I don't have time to dig into the details of recursive SQL queries at present. The main issue is that my version is likely to be slow, so some optimisation may be necessary.\n",

I can then extract just the three columns of interest - `tax_id`, `parent_tax_id` and `rank_id`. \n",

    "The flattened NCBI data provides full taxonomic information for each `tax_id`. In principle, this should make it possible to perform aggregation at any taxonomic level. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** Back in November 2016, Knut Erik asked me to modify some existing views in the database, such that grouping took place based on the `LATIN_NAME` column rather than the `SPECIES_GROUP`. In the end, I created a new view called `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_SPECIES` (see e-mails around 14/11/2016 for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the newly formatted NCBI data, it should be possible to generate a similar table by grouping based on `NCBI_RANK=4`, which corresponds to species. We can then check to see how aggregation via NCBI ranks compares to aggregation using Latin names, which should provide a useful test. To explore this, I've used the following workflow in the database:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Created two new views, `ECOTOX_EXTRACT1_M_NCBI` and `ECOTOX_LIKE_EXTRACT1_NCBI`. These are identical to `ECOTOX_EXTRACT1_M` and `ECOTOX_LIKE_EXTRACT1`, except I've joined-in the NCBI ranks by matching NCBI `NAME_TXT` to RAdb `LATIN_NAME`. As noted above, not all the names can be matched, so this **needs further checking**. <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Created two new views called `ECOTOX_SUM_EFF_PRI_SPEC` and `ECOTOX_SUM_EFF_REV_SPEC`, which are the same as `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_PRIMARY` and `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_REVIEW`, except the grouping is performed on `NCBI_RANK=4` (species) instead of on `LATIN_NAME` or `SPECIES_GROUP` as we have done previously. <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Created a new view called `ECOTOX_SUM_EFF_SPEC`, which combines the results from `ECOTOX_SUM_EFF_PRI_SPEC` and `ECOTOX_SUM_EFF_REV_SPEC` (exactly analogous to the way `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT` combines output from `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_PRIMARY` and `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_REVIEW`).\n",
    " \n",
    "In summary, `ECOTOX_SUM_EFF_SPEC` is based on the NCBI data aggregated at `RANK=4`, whereas the table I created back in November (called `ECOTOX_SUMMARY_EFFECT_SPECIES`) is based on aggregation using the RAdb `LATIN_NAME`. These two tables are similar, but not the same, so **they need checking carefully to make sure the values based on the NCBI data look reasonable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following issues need further investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Not all Latin names in our database have exact matches in the NCBI database.  <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * In a few cases, the Latin name specified in the RAdb matches more than one tax_id in NCBI_NAMES. This results in some duplication i.e. the same Latin name gets assigned to more than one level in the taxonomic tree. This may lead to contradictory results.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 4. Matching NCBI names to the RAdb\n",
    "\n",
